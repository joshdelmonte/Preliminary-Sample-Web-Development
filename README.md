# PRELIMINARY-WEBPAGE

## Description

    -The motivation of this project was to refactor and debug the code to a more condense form for both HTML and CSS to reresent 95% of the original.

   - The reason being I wanted to hone my refactoring skills and further understanding the alteration of a webpage to function while accomodating a handicap friendly layout.

    -This solves the issue of having too much code while still making the page functional for users.

    -From this all, I've learned and will continue to learn the art of refactoring and making a page more user friendly.
