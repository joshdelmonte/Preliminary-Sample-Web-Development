# WK1-HW-WEBPAGE

## Description

    The motivation of this project was to refactor and debug the code to a more condense form for both HTML and CSS to reresent 95% of the original.

    The reason being I wanted to hone my refactoring skills and further understanding the alteration of a webpage to function while accomodating a handicap friendly layout.

    This solves the issue of having too much code while still making the page functional for users.

    From this all, I've learned and will continue to learn the art of refactoring and making a page more user friendly.
